`cyclegan_inference.ipynb/py` can be run, resulting in a Gradio web app demo. This is a temporary web app that is not persistent. For a persistent web app, a Heroku web app can be made. The code for this is available in this folder, following [this guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deploy-a-machine-learning-ui-on-heroku-in-5-steps-b8cd3c9208e6) but it has not been tested yet.
